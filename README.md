## General Information
- Zeppelin Zeppa during her air journey tries to collect valuable coins. She shouldn't touch the sun, baloons or hit the mountains. 
- There are 3 kinds of upgrades to buy between the levels.
- I've made this small game to learn basics of Unity designing, especially spawning, moving, animating objects, adding some SFX and working with layers. 
- It was big fun till the moment my 6-years daughter said: "Daddy, I like it but you should make a shop". "What? Ehm... OK". So during next 2 weeks I've been creating simple shop and upgrades for my daughter.
- I realized that it's very difficult to finish the project (especially at the end), just stop adding new "better" functionalities, stop permanently reviewing the code. 
- Most of "small changes that will surely improve my game" appeared to be time wasters.
